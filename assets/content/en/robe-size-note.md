The final size is reached when the cloth shrinks after the first washing. The
total cut size is scaled up to account for shrinking. The kusi size is not
changed for easier marking, the extra size is added by increasing only the
border and the mandala.

Units are in centimeters. On the pattern, fractions are rounded to millimeters
only when displayed, the internal calculations don't round the values.

Use the increasing width values along the edges for marking on the cloth, this
will not accumulate errors from rounding.
