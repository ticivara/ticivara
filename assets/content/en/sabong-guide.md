# Sabong Sewing Guide

Determine the final size and mark the cloth.

Keep in mind the top and bottom side of the cloth.

If the cloth is not tall enough to draw the sabong as one piece, divide at the
khandha lines as necessary and draw the khandhas horizontally on the cloth.

In the case of separate khandas, allow 1cm cutting buffers at the side edges
where khandhas will be joined, and 5-10cm shifting buffers at the top and bottom
edge of the khandhas.

Fold and make the first sewing. Keep in mind to not sew too narrow, the second
sewing will be closer to the edge of the cloth.

Observe the sequence of the lines: (1) broken, (2) cross, (3) long. The second
sewing is in the same sequence.

If the cloth was cut as one piece, it is ready for the second sewing.

If it was cut from separate pieces, these have to be joined now.

The join has to hide both open edges.

For the second sewing, fold the cloth outward from the kusis, flatten and sew
along the edge.

This way on the outside of the cloth there will be one visible sewing line, and
on the inside there will be two.

In the second sewing, the folding direction has to be observed so that the kusis
are lower than the mandalas.

Make a hem around the edges at 1cm.

Add the [borders](/#/en/borders).
