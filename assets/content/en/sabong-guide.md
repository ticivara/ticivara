# Sabong Sewing Guide

## Planning the cutting layout

Measure the cloth and plan how the sabong and the borders are going to fit.

If the cloth is not wide enough for the sabong to be drawn and cut as one piece, determine which
khandas will be cut out separately. Draw them horizontally on the cloth, instead of the vertical
orientation seen on the pattern diagram.

On the drawing, the cutting lines are the long vertical lines.

In the case of separate khandas, the pattern calculator implies a 1cm cutting buffer at the side
edges where khandhas will be joined, and 5-10cm shifting buffers at the top and bottom edge of the
khandhas.

The separate khandas will be joined along these lines after the first and second sewing is
completed.

The thread orientation of the cloth has to be observed and kept consistent between the separate
pieces. The cloth streches to a different degree when pulled in the vertical or horizontal
direction. If this is mixed up, the different orientation will cause the material to wrinkle.

The borders may fit in one length, but may have to be sewn from joining separate pieces to maintain
the thread orientation.

First, determine how much of the total cloth is going to be needed to fit the sabong and the
borders, and cut off this appriximate size from the main cloth roll.

Wash it at 40 degrees, to make sure the cloth shrinks before drawing the marks.

Dry and iron.

Identify the top side (aka. 'right side') and bottom side (aka. 'wrong side') of
the cloth. The top side is going to face outward for everyone to see, and the bottom
side is going to face inward.

The top side is slightly more reflective, and the bottom is more
matt. When a corner is folded over, the difference may be possible to tell
when looking at a low angle to see how the light reflects off the fabric.

The 'selvage' is the edge of the fabric where the pins of the machine
were holding the cloth during manufacturing, and so they have a slightly
different colour.

If there is printed text on the selvage (such as a brand name), the text is on
the top side.

The selvage has pinholes where the pins of the machine were inserted. The pins
are inserted from the bottom side, and they leave a conical depression on the
selvage. If you run your finger along the edge, you will feel raised dots on the
top side.

## Marking the cloth

Lay out the cloth with the **bottom side facing up**.

For a **sabong**, draw the marks on the **bottom side**.

Determine the final size with the pattern calculator and mark the cloth.

## First sewing

Start with the broken lines. Pinch the cloth and crease it along the drawn line.

Fold and make the first sewing, at about 5mm from the edge.

Keep in mind to not sew too narrow, the second sewing will be made between this sewn line and the
edge of the fold.

Observe the sequence of the lines: (1) broken vertical, (2) short horizontal, (3) long vertical.

The beginning and end of the lines don't need to be locked with reverse sewing. Around the edge of
the cloth, the hem and the boder will lock the threads. At the kusis where the broken lines end, the
next line will cross it and lock the thread.

When sewing the broken lines, one may start at one end of the cloth, stop where the line crosses the
kusi. The needle can be then lifted across the kusi, continuing to sew the broken line on the other
side of the kusi.

When getting close to the 'T' intersection of kusis, keep in mind that the flap will
have to be folded over. Take care not to sew the crossing part locked in the
wrong folding direction.

After one group of lines is finished, such as after the broken lines, pinch and crease the cloth
along one of the lines in the next group. Fold and sew along the edge, closing the T at the place
where the lines meet.

## Second sewing

The second sewing is in the same sequence as the first.

For the second sewing, fold the cloth outward from the kusis, flatten and sew between the first
sewing and the edge of the fold.

When getting to a few stiches away from the 'T' intersection of kusis, stop the
needle and turn the cloth slightly, sewing in direction towards the inner corner
of the intersection. This allows less stress on the fabric, and reduces bundled
areas.

This way on the outside of the cloth there will be one visible sewing line, and
on the inside there will be two.

In the second sewing, the folding direction has to be observed so that the kusis
are lower than the middle sections.

If it was cut from separate pieces, these have to be joined now. The join has to hide both open
edges. The joining fold is made by two sewing lines, which are effectively the first and second
sewing along the long vertical lines.

## Trim and Fold a Hem

When sewing the pattern on a single piece of main cloth, the sewing lines pull in the fabric and the
edge of the cloth is no longer going to be a straight line. The variation is usually about 3-5mm.

Place a ruler along the edges and determine if the edge has to be trimmed to make them straight.

When sewing from separate pieces, the places where panels are joined usually have some variation in
the alignment as well, and they may need to be trimmed along the edges all around the cloth, to
create even and straight edges.

After trimming the edges, fold up 1cm on the edge of the cloth to make a hem, but instead of sewing,
it is sufficient to iron and pin it. When placing the border on top, sewing the border is going to
fix the hem in place as well.
