# Civara Sewing Guide

The civara is between the sabong and a sanghati in difficulty.

Cut the cloth as you would for a [sanghati](/#/en/sanghati-guide), except you
only cut for one layer, and you don't have to cut all the khandhas to be
separate, it is enough to cut them in groups of three (to fit in the size of the
cloth material), as indicated on the [civara pattern](/#/en/civara-pattern).

These groups of three are sewn with a first- and second-sewing as with a
[sabong](/#/en/sabong-guide) to produce the pattern of kusis and mandalas.

After that, join the groups of threes and [add the borders](/#/en/borders).
