\chapter{Civara Sewing Guide}

The civara is between the sabong and a sanghati in difficulty.

Cut the cloth as you would for a \href{/en/sanghati-guide}{sanghati},
except you only cut for one layer, and you don't have to cut all the
khandhas to be separate, it is enough to cut them in groups of three (to
fit in the size of the cloth material), as indicated on the
\href{/en/civara-pattern}{civara pattern}.

These groups of three are sewn with a first- and second-sewing as with a
\href{/en/sabong-guide}{sabong}.

After that, join the groups of threes and \href{/en/borders}{add the
borders}.
